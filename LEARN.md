# Learn About Programming Quiz

Welcome to the **Programming Quiz** project! This document will help you understand how to work with this JavaFX-based quiz application, covering the key concepts and providing guidance on getting started.

## Overview

**Programming Quiz** is a JavaFX application designed to test programming knowledge through a quiz format. The application uses JavaFX for the graphical user interface and incorporates object-oriented programming principles such as constructors, classes, arrays, and CSS styling.

## Key Concepts

### JavaFX GUI

- **JavaFX** is a framework for building rich client applications with a modern user interface. This project utilizes JavaFX to create an interactive quiz experience.

### Object-Oriented Design

- **Constructors:** Special methods used to initialize objects. The quiz application uses constructors to set up the initial state of the quiz components.
- **Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects. The project employs classes to define quiz questions, user responses, and scoring mechanisms.
- **Arrays:** Data structures used to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays manage collections of quiz questions and answers.

### CSS Styling

- **Custom CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control the look and feel of the application. Custom CSS enhances the visual appeal of the JavaFX components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure that you have JDK 11 or later installed. This is necessary to compile and run the JavaFX application.

### Running the Application

1. **Download the JAR File:**
    - Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/nirajan128/Programming-Quiz/releases) section of the repository.
    - Download the latest JAR file (e.g., `programming-quiz.jar`).

2. **Execute the JAR File:**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Change directory to where the JAR file is located.
    - Run the command:
      ```sh
      java -jar programming-quiz.jar
      ```

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code files written in Java.
- **`resources/`**: Holds CSS files and other resources used by the application.
- **`out/artifacts/`**: Includes the JAR file and other build artifacts.
